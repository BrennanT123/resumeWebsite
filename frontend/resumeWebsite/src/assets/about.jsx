                  I graduated from The Ohio State University in May 2023 with a
                  degree in Mechanical Engineering. During my time in college, I
                  focused on building strong coding skills, applying them across
                  a variety of technical projects. Some of these include...

                  For the last 2 years, I worked as a Design Engineer at Honda
                  R&D desining tailgates for new Honda models. During this time, I gained valuable experience operating
                  in a <b>fast-paced, high-pressure environment</b> that demands {" "}
                  <b>precision</b> and <b>attention to detail</b>. Honda's culture of
                  excellence taught me how to uphold <b>high standards</b> in every
                  aspect of my work.

                  Over the past year, I've spent the majority of my free time
                  teaching myself full-stack application development. Driven by
                  my desire to continuously learn, I've built a strong foundation
                  in technologies like Node.js, React, PostgreSQL, Prisma, and
                  Express.
